    <h2>Image of the Balti</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe of my favourite nigerian dish called Balti. </p>
    <p>Balti is a beloved dish in many countries across West Africa and each one has its own unique version</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
<li>TOMATOES</li>
<li>RICE</li>
<li>RED PEPPER</li>
<li>CHILLI PEPPER</li>
<li>SCOTCH BONNET</li>
<li>ONIONS</li>
<li>RED OIL</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps for cooking</h4>
    <ol>
<li>Bring to a boil, then turn down to low heat and cook for 20 minutes without removing the lid.</li>
<li>Turn off the heat after 20 minutes, DO NOT REMOVE THE LID; you need the steam for it to continue cooking the rice for another 20 minutes</li>
<li>After the full cooking time, remove the lid and use a fork to fluff up the Balti. There will be a layer of rice stuck to the bottom of the pan. This is due to the cooking time with direct heat on the bottom with the natural sugars from the tomato base.</li>
<li>Enjoy a flavorful dish of Balti with the perfect complement: tender cooked vegetables or sweet fried plantains. Boiled eggs are another favourite.</li>
